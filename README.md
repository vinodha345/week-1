📂# week-1-Design Phase Summary

Project Name : REAL-TIME FABRIC CLASSIFICATION USING ONNX and COMPUTER VISION
 
🧩 Problem Statement

The fashion industry significantly contributes to environmental pollution because it heavily uses slow-to-decompose, non-biodegradable synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon. A key challenge to improving recycling is the absence of automated systems that can quickly and accurately identify different fabric types and their sustainability characteristics for large-scale sorting. 

💡 Solution :

This project proposes a Clothing Material Classification System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — a deep learning model capable of recognizing and categorizing different clothing materials from images.

Expected output:

1. Identifies the Type of Cloth (e.g., Cotton, Polyester, Denim, Silk, etc.)

2. Detects if the Fabric is Mixed or Pure (e.g., Cotton + Polyester)

3. Displays Biodegradability Information (Yes/No)

4. Shows Estimated Time to Decompose in Soil

5. Indicates if the Material is Recyclable

6. Displays Model Accuracy using a Pie Chart

7. Performs Live Prediction — provides instant results for any input.

Outcome:
Successfully completed the system design phase, finalized the project architecture, selected and prepared the dataset source, and planned the model training workflow for real-time fabric classification using ONNX and computer vision.

📂# week-2 - Implementation Phase Summary
Implementation Overview: "Testing model was implemented".
Project Name: REAL-TIME FABRIC CLASSIFICATION USING ONNX and COMPUTER VISION".
Dataset taken: "The Fabrics Dataset by iBUG" from kaggle.

🔍 Code Overview:
Section                     	Description
Imports & Setup	             Loads libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, PIL, Matplotlib, etc.
Dataset Paths                Uses train and validation folders (dataset_split/train, dataset_split/validation).
Data Checking                Verifies both folders contain the same fabric classes.
Data Augmentation	           Performs rescaling, shearing, zooming, flipping, etc.
Model	                       Builds a transfer learning model using MobileNetV2 (ImageNet weights).
Training	                    Uses ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping callbacks.
Evaluation	                  Displays validation accuracy and a pie chart.
Fabric Info	                 Stores eco-related info for each fabric (biodegradability, recyclability, etc.).
Prediction Functions	
Includes:                    *predict_image(model, img_path) for single image prediction.
                             *live_predict(model) for real-time webcam predictions.
