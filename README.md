# week-1-Design Phase Summary

Project Name : REAL-TIME FABRIC CLASSIFICATION USING ONNX and COMPUTER VISION
 
🧩 Problem Statement

The fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution due to excessive use of synthetic, non-biodegradable fabrics and limited recycling processes. Materials like polyester and nylon can take decades or even centuries to decompose, causing soil and water pollution.

A major challenge is the lack of automated systems that can identify fabric types and determine their sustainability characteristics. Manual testing is time-consuming and impractical for large-scale textile sorting and recycling operations.

💡 Solution :

This project proposes a Clothing Material Classification System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — a deep learning model capable of recognizing and categorizing different clothing materials from images.

Once an image of a cloth is given (either uploaded or captured live), the model performs the following:

1. Identifies the Type of Cloth (e.g., Cotton, Polyester, Denim, Silk, etc.)

2. Detects if the Fabric is Mixed or Pure (e.g., Cotton + Polyester)

3. Displays Biodegradability Information (Yes/No)

4. Shows Estimated Time to Decompose in Soil

5. Indicates if the Material is Recyclable

6. Displays Model Accuracy using a Pie Chart

7. Performs Live Prediction — provides instant results for any input.

🌱 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how AI and Deep Learning can be used for promoting sustainable fashion.
The system not only classifies fabric types with high accuracy but also provides useful environmental insights, helping in:
