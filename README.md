# week-1-Design Phase Summary

Project Name : REAL-TIME FABRIC CLASSIFICATION USING ONNX and COMPUTER VISION
 
🧩 Problem Statement

The fashion industry significantly contributes to environmental pollution because it heavily uses slow-to-decompose, non-biodegradable synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon. A key challenge to improving recycling is the absence of automated systems that can quickly and accurately identify different fabric types and their sustainability characteristics for large-scale sorting. 

💡 Solution :

This project proposes a Clothing Material Classification System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — a deep learning model capable of recognizing and categorizing different clothing materials from images.

Expected output:

1. Identifies the Type of Cloth (e.g., Cotton, Polyester, Denim, Silk, etc.)

2. Detects if the Fabric is Mixed or Pure (e.g., Cotton + Polyester)

3. Displays Biodegradability Information (Yes/No)

4. Shows Estimated Time to Decompose in Soil

5. Indicates if the Material is Recyclable

6. Displays Model Accuracy using a Pie Chart

7. Performs Live Prediction — provides instant results for any input.
